    <h1>Evaluation Details</h1>

    <p>
      MuMA-ToM is a multi-modal multi-agent Theory of Mind benchmark designed to evaluate mental reasoning in embodied
      multi-agent interactions. Each trial depicts a social interaction in video and text jointly, and each question asks
      about agents’ mental states based on the multi-modal context.
    </p>

    <h2>What we evaluate</h2>
    <p>
      We evaluate performance on three types of Theory of Mind questions:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Belief inference</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Social goal inference</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Belief of goal inference</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Primary metric</h2>
    <p>
      The primary metric is <strong>accuracy</strong> on multiple-choice questions.
      For each question, a submission must select exactly one option from <span class="mono">A</span>,
      <span class="mono">B</span>, or <span class="mono">C</span>. A prediction is correct if it matches the ground-truth option.
    </p>

          <td>Accuracy computed over belief inference questions only.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>

      <p>
        Questions are designed so that the correct answer can be inferred from the multi-modal interaction, conditioned on
        explicitly provided assumptions about other relevant mental variables. This is intended to address ambiguity arising
        from multiple plausible combinations of beliefs and goals in multi-agent interactions.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>Benchmark composition</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>225 multi-modal social interactions between two agents.</li>
      <li>900 multiple-choice questions based on these interactions.</li>
      <li>Three question categories with 300 questions each.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Human baseline (reference)</h2>
    <p>
      In the accompanying human experiment, participants achieved near-perfect performance, with majority agreement on
      almost all questions, and an overall performance averaged across individual participants reported in the paper.
      We include this as a reference point for interpreting model performance on the benchmark.
    </p>

    <h2>Submission evaluation</h2>
    <p>
      We evaluate each submission by comparing its predicted option for each question ID against the ground-truth answer,
      then computing accuracy overall and by question type. The leaderboard is ranked by <strong>Overall Accuracy</strong>
      by default, and we report the category breakdowns for analysis.
